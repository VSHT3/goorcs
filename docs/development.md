# Development workflow

## Setup

1. Install the standard Godot **4.7.2 stable** executable from the [official downloads](https://godotengine.org/download/). Keep collaborators on the same version; upgrade deliberately.
2. Clone the private repository and import `project.godot` into Godot.
3. Run the main scene with F5. The initial application displays the Goorcs title.

No Node.js, .NET SDK, external packages, export templates, or MCP servers are required to run the current project in Godot. Export templates will be needed when distributing desktop builds.

The commands below assume the Godot binary is available as `godot`; substitute its absolute path if necessary.

```sh
# Open the editor.
godot --editor --path .

# Run the project.
godot --path .

# Import resources without opening a graphical editor.
godot --headless --path . --import

# Smoke-run the current main scene, then quit.
godot --headless --path . --quit-after 10
```

A headless pass verifies that the project loads and runs, not that the visuals or interactions are correct. Inspect runtime errors as well as the exit status.

## Agent conventions

- Prefer small, playable changes and recoverable Git commits.
- Use typed GDScript and ordinary Godot scenes/resources. Do not introduce a custom engine or framework without a concrete need.
- Keep gameplay data separate from behavior as actual content is introduced.
- Keep documentation accurate about what exists versus what is only proposed.
- Do not introduce paid services, MCP plugins, public access, or credentials without an explicit project decision.
- Do not overwrite unsaved editor changes. Coordinate file edits and editor saves.
- Commit source scenes, scripts, resources, and Godot UID sidecars. Do not commit `.godot/`, build outputs, or credentials.

## Verification as the game grows

For a gameplay change, run the game and exercise the changed action. Use screenshots and input automation where available, plus human playtesting for feel and balance.

For networking changes, launch separate host and client processes and verify the resulting authoritative state. Before declaring internet support, play a match between separate machines and networks; localhost is not proof of NAT traversal or acceptable latency.

The first multiplayer milestone should be completed before building extensive progression and content systems.

## Optional Godot bridges

### Coding-Solo/godot-mcp

[Repository](https://github.com/Coding-Solo/godot-mcp)

MIT-licensed bridge for launching Godot, capturing debug output, and basic scene/resource operations. During tool evaluation, its current source successfully reported the engine version, created a scene, and added a node; Godot then ran that generated scene headlessly. Its inspected tool list did not include screenshot capture or input simulation.

It is not installed in this project.

### Godot MCP Pro

[Asset listing](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/4961) · [Repository](https://github.com/youichi-uda/godot-mcp-pro)

Candidate for screenshots, input simulation, and live game inspection. The public repository provides the editor addon; the required server is distributed in a paid package. Advertised runtime capabilities have not been independently verified for this project. Use matched addon/server versions if adopted.

Before relying on it, verify actual game screenshots, UI input and state changes, runtime error retrieval, and how separate multiplayer instances are targeted. A bridge does not remove the need for a working graphical runtime.

Keep development automation local, enable available connection authentication, and never expose editor-control ports as part of the game's multiplayer service. Ensure development-only tooling is excluded from distributed builds.

## Initialization verification

The project initialization is checked with a headless resource import and main-scene run. Graphical appearance, input interaction, desktop exports, and internet multiplayer require separate verification.
